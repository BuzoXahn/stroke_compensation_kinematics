	[A] Add additional steps: screen preset, accuracy test 

	To calculate the intrinsic RMS error of sensors, two more steps are
	added. During the screen preset, screen will be fixed and during the
	accuracy test, the RMS error will be checked by comparing sensored
	values to values measured by a ruler.
